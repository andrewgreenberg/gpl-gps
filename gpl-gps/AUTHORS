Sometime in the 1990's Andrew Greenberg proposed that the Portland State
Aerospace society create some open source GPS software. Eventually we learned
of the existing OSGPS project and decided to port that to Linux. (originally
OSGPS was written for MSDOS in Borland C++.) Little progress was made however
until Takuji Ebinuma undertook the effort and successfully got a subset of
OSGPS to run on the GP4020 under Linux using the JaysOS real-time operating
system.

Tak's work and Andrew's expiring university credits were finally enough to get
gpl-gps going again, and in April 2005 gpl-gps finally appeared in CVS.
