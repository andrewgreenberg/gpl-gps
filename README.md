# DEPRECATED: The GPL-GPS Project

This is the code and documentation from the GPL-GPS project, from back in 2005. It's code to run the now end-of-lifed Zarlink GP4020 IC (ARM + GPS receiver) IC using the eCOS operating system and some custom code. It was my master's thesis project from the early 2000s. 

Good luck; although I'll probably not be able to help answer questions any more, I'd love to know if the project is useful to you!
